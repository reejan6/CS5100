This folder contains the models that can be used for future work. 
MentalHealthHypo.md contains a methodology developed that is very efficient for SER purposes - it's based on The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse. The DFT is used to convert a sequence of complex numbers from the time domain to the frequency domain.
models_sharded.py - Contains architecture of the model
hubert.py - Bert model for audio data.
testing.py - Contains a pipeline responsible for testing the model.
train.py - Contains a pipeline responsible for training the model.
