Model for an audio cnn with plots and accuracy.
two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a Transformer for feature extraction and classification. The two CNNs, cnn1 and cnn2, consist of convolutional, max-pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers to extract hierarchical spatial features from input data. Additionally, the Transformer module (self.transformer) enhances the model's ability to capture global context and sequential dependencies in the data. Features extracted from both CNNs and the Transformer are concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer (lin_head) for classification into 8 classes, followed by a softmax activation to produce probabilities. This architecture is versatile for tasks requiring a combination of local feature extraction and global context understanding.
